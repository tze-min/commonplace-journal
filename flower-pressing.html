    <h1>Flower pressing: my learnings</h1>
    <p>Return to <a href="index.html">home</a>.</p>

    <h2>Materials used</h2>
    <p>I watched a couple of YouTube tutorials to see what I needed, and it took 1-2 batches of pressed flowers (that came out in varying quality) before I settled on a routine. I didn't need fancy tools, like presses made of wood and cardboard and weights as heavy as bricks. I made use of what I had.</p>
    <p>The basics:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Paper material</b>: the more absorbent the better, but photocopy paper works alright. I keep a stack of mail I don't need and reuse them as flower pressing paper.</li>
        <li><b>Weight</b>: books, plates, computers, etc. as long as the bottom's flat and weight's distributed evenly across it. Depending on the pressing method, I use either books or plates.</li>
        <li><b>A source of plants</b>: I'll expand on this in one of the below sections, especially on the ethics of it.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The nice to have:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Microwave</b>: only if you're using the microwave method, though I use it most of the time.</li>
        <li><b>Tweezers</b>: helpful for moving small and delicate plant material around, especially when they're the sort to be stuck limply to paper prior to drying.</li>
        <li><b>Containers / binders</b> as storage space for pressed flowers: I use plastic containers that local hawker centres give out to store sauces when I get takeaway; they're great for small flowers. For bigger flowers, I slide them in between the plain pages of a cheap sketchbook, though I've seen others slide them between papers and store those papers in a plastic folder, or keep them between pages of old, bound tutorial notes.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Starting out</h2>
    <p>I had no idea what worked and didn't work. Lots of online tutorials said the traditional method of using a book press, i.e. leaving a flower in between the pages of a thick book, stacking more heavy books on top of it, and forgetting about it for four weeks, works wonders for them. The flower and leaves turn out great.</p>
    <p>That was not the case for mine.</p>
    <p>I'd picked up a couple of flowers from the sidewalk while wandering in my neighborhood. I figured if book-presses worked for centuries, it can't hurt to try it.</p> 
    <p>So I left my flowers in between copy paper of mail and put them between old books. I checked them after a day, then after two days, and wow: a couple of flowers maintained their color's vibrancy, but most, disappointingly, browned or blackened. They didn't rot and fall apart; they <i>dried</i>, but they didn't look too hot. Instead of being excited about what I'd do with the dried flowers, I betted which ones would make it and which would not.</p>
    <p>I also didn't know when the flowers were considered done. At the one-week mark, I thought they were dry. Then at the two-week mark, I thought, "Surely they have to be ready." At the three-week mark, I thought the same thing.</p>
    <p>Now, though, I know what dry flowers look - and feel - like. I also know which flower species press well, and which didn't. I know when to use book-presses and when to use other methods, like a microwave. People online recommend ways such as pressing them with an iron without water, or buying a professional flower press, but I figured it'd be fine to leave those alone; I'd found what worked for me.</p>
    
    <h2>Learnings</h2>

    <h3>The science behind how flowers get pressed and preserved</h2>
    <p>No matter what method's used, the aim of flower pressing is to dry and flatten them. That's how they're able to last for decades: by geeting water content out of their petals, stems or leaves, they're less likely to rot, even if they turn brown or fade in color.</p>
    <p>Therefore, if you stick your flowers/leaves in between books and leave them alone, the aim <i>isn't</i> to squish them till they're as flat as possible. You might just end up with a squished, wet and rotting plant.</p>
    <p>If you flatten your plant between paper material and put it in a microwave or under an iron, the aim's <i>not</i> to burn or squeeze it flat; the aim's to evaporate the water content with just enough heat, while the paper material absorbs the plant's moisture.</p>

    <h3>Factors affecting the effectiveness of flower pressing</h3>
    <p>Therefore, the effectiveness of flower pressing depends on a few factors:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Your climate</li>
        <li>Plant species</li>
        <li>Colour of flower</li>
        <li>Plant's stage of life</li>
        <li>Absorbency of the paper used and the air circulation your plants get during pressing</li>
        <li>Temperature and duration of heat in a microwave</li>
        <li>How you store them after pressing</li>
    </ol>

    <dl>
        <dt>Your climate</dt>
        <dd>The more humid and warmer where you are, the longer it'll take for your plant material to dry out in the open. I've seen brown, fallen leaves perfectly dried and preserved in the dead of winter of a semi-arid / arid location, while flowers remain damp even after weeks of being book-pressed in Singapore.</dd>
        <dt>Plant species</dt>
        <dd>I've heard from online sources that tropical flowers don't press well, but being in the tropics, tropical flowers is what I can find. There aren't as many resources out there for pressing tropical flowers, so finding this out took trial and error. Ixoras do great in book-presses and microwaves alike. Frangipanis, crossandras and yellow bells maintain their colours' vibrancy for months after I microwave them a little, and are also alright if I leave them in between papers afterwards. Petunias do okay in microwaves but terribly in book-presses. The sole orchid (a vanda miss joaquim / papilionanthe miss joaqium) I picked up from the ground did not press well at <i>all</i>; it stuck wetly to the paper in the microwave. So it depends on the amount of water content their petals hold, and whether they have thick stems or receptacles that you might want to cut away or cut in half so they dry more quickly.</dd>
        <dt>Colour of flower</dt>
        <dd>I've given up trying to pick up and press white flowers; they turn yellow by the time I get them into the press or after I dry them. Colours that have done well seem to be red/orange/yellow, as well as purple/blue. I've noticed pink flowers tend to become brown really quickly; my pink petunias all turn brownish after drying, while the dark purple ones retain its hue, though at times unevenly.</dd>
        <dt>Plant's stage of life</dt>
        <dd>I've read online that the fresher the flower, the better able it's able to retain its original colour. I don't pluck flowers from public gardens as I don't think it's right, but it does mean I don't know much about comparing the pressing quality of a newly bloomed flower snipped from the stem, versus a flower that's recently fallen off. But I did notice that the more wilted the flower's become, the more yellow and limp it'll be. Brown spots become darker and more pronounced after drying, and if you're using the book-press in a warm / not well-circulated area, the brown spots spread.</dd>
        <dt>Absorbency of the paper used and the air circulation your plants get during pressing</dt>
        <dd>I researched why my original book-press didn't work. Turns out, the important thing to do in a book-press and professional flower press is to set the plant between layers of different absorbent materials. Recommended materials include: newspapers, flat corrugated cardboard and blotting papers. The corrugated cardboard, especially, contains air holes that allow air to circulate through the layers, which allows the moisture to evaporate out from them rather than stay trapped in the paper, causing the plant to rot anyway. This plus the tropical humidity of my first book-press attempt turned my plants into dark yellows and browns. While I don't care much for air circulation in a microwave, for thick or damp flowers, I might add more layers of paper around the plant, so the water has a place to escape to, from the petals.</dd>
        <dt>Temperature and duration of heat in a microwave</dt>
        <dd>I didn't want to burn / fry my flowers into crisps by leaving them in the microwave for too long. I normally press the plant between photocopy paper, set a plate on top of it, and heat the plant in 15 - 30 second intervals, usually to a maximum of 2 minutes. After every interval, I take out the plant and let the heat dissisipate till it's at room temperature. Depending on your microwave's settings and power, the interval duration could differ.</dd>
        <dt>How you store them after pressing</dt>
        <dd>I keep the pressed flowers out of sunlight / artificial light, as their colours are known to fade in the light. For big flowers and leaves, I keep them between paper, which keeps them dry; they'll still rot if they collect moisture from the air. For small flowers, putting them in plastic containers, then storing those containers in dry drawers, works for me.</dd>
