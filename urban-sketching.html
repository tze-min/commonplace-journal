  <h2>Tutorials referenced</h2>
  <p>I don't want to pressure myself; journaling gave my mind clarity. But that doesn't mean I don't want to improve my sketching skills, because drawing and painting engaged me with my surroundings, made me pay attention to them, and as a result, made me remember what I'd been doing and where I'd been.</p>
