What it entails

- Tag-navigation using JavaScript and buttons :) my first time properly learning JS syntax + async/await 
- GitHub workflows set up to run a Python file that generates metadata of my posts, upon pushing to main

Resources

- [javascript.info](https://javascript.info) for JS fundamentals and data types
- [Claude](https://claude.ai) - great for troubleshooting my yaml files

Up next

- Auto-generation of the RSS feed upon pushing to main
- Ability to deselect buttons and unfilter posts
- Ensuring the tags and posts work on mobile

What it entails

- Vanilla HTML hosted on Cloudflare Pages
- A styles sheet where I had fun changing link colours when I hover above them + learning about flex containers and viewports
- RSS feed, currently manually written

Resources

- [Flexbox Froggy](https://flexboxfroggy.com) for learning flex containers

Up next

- Tag-navigation system, because I don't want to cram all my writing into select few pages
- Auto-generation of post metadata and the RSS feed upon pushing to main
