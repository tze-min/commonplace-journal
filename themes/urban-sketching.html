  <h2>Starting out and learnings</h2>

  <h3>How I got into it</h3>
  <p>I listed a whole lot of materials up there, but I don't think... I need them all. They were bought either when discounted or when I wanted to try out a medium for the first time. Currently, the stuff I wanted to try evolved this way:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Travel journalling, because I had several overseas trips coming up and I'd bought my ecomaz travel notebook on a whim. This initially involved way more writing than drawing.</li>
    <li>Pencil sketches of the places I went to and the food I ate. It was easier to draw food, even an impression of it, than describe it with words.</li>
    <li>Found an old black ink pen (a freebie from a college career fair years ago) and my drawings became ink sketches.</li>
    <li>Got my hands on a set of cheap Faber-Castell colour pencils, and soon those sketches filled with color.</li>
    <li>My colouring always looked flat. Some searching of tutorials later, I figured out how to shade and blend with colour pencils, and soon I came across the idea of urban sketching online. Most urban sketchers used fineliner pens and watercolours.</li>
    <li>My black ink pen was too thick and kept smudging. Went out and bought myself a fineliner, a Sakura Micron 0.3. With it, I started to draw buildings. They didn't look great because I made mistakes everywhere, but I discovered I could greatly improve them (aka cover up mistakes) by colouring them in. I did so with the coloured pencils.</li>
    <li>A friend invites me out to use their watercolours. I try that for the first time and discover my ecomaz journal could, in fact, hold water-based paints.</li>
    <li>I buy the cheapest watercolour paint set. By Faber-Castell, it came with 12 cakes, a built-in palette and a little brush. All I needed was an extra plastic container to hold water, of which I had many at home. My buildings and random urban scenery became outlined with ink first, then filled with watercolor.</li>
  </ol>
  
  <p>I could've stopped there. But the more I tried watercolouring and the more artists I followed, the more I began to realise several limitations with the materials I had. Water dried rapidly on the ecomaz journal's paper and the round brush that came with the Faber-Castell paint set didn't hold much water, so I'd run out of paint quickly in my strokes. It resulted in having to put more layers of paint on the paper, but this made the latter look roughed-up.</p>
  <p>I was also encountering other issues like being unable to try out most of the watercoloring techniques I read about online (mostly because of the paper's absorbency), and the paper wrinkling from the water. My small round brush didn't let me paint large surfaces easily. Plus, I began to want more colours, because who doesn't want more colours?</p>
  <p>So the minute I saw an 80% discount on 24 tubes of watercolor paint, I got them, alongside a cheap plastic palette and watercolour paper. I went out of my way to get gouache, this opaque watercolour I've heard so much about, because I figured I might as well try it. I was also given a set of Daler-Rowney brushes, some painter's tape and additional watercolor paper as a gift, though to be honest painter's tape was overkill... masking tape would've been fine.</p>

  <h3>Impact of materials on watercolour/gouache painting</h3>
  <p>Some of these are obvious in hindsight, but I only really understood it when I tried it:</p>
  <p>A good brush that holds large amounts of water really makes a difference in how often you need to pick up paint from the palette. The Daler-Rowney round brush was about the same size as the Faber-Castell round brush, but the former gives me such awesome control over where I want the paint to go on the paper as well.</p>
  <p>Watercolor paper (or anything with a high percentage of cotton in them) allows water to sit on the surface for a longer time, which means you start being able to do the typical techniques you hear about online, e.g. wet on wet, dragging, charging. But painting on such paper felt like learning a whole new practice again, because I'd gotten used to painting on the ecomaz paper, in terms of how much water I should mix into the paint, how long I should wait for a layer to dry before putting on the second one, etc.</p>
  <p>I haven't noticed a huge difference, paint-wise.</p>

  <h3>Impact of materials on sketching</h3>
  <p>I used to never understand the appeal of using ink. What if you messed up? But I really get it now. It's to make you commit to your strokes, because they're not erasable like pencils are. If you make a mistake, you just work with it, and if it really can't be salvaged, you could always start over. It's not the end of the world.</p>
  <p>I never went back to my old ink pen (that was thick and easily smudged) after getting the fineliner, because the latter gave me a lot more control over my strokes, which also became more even.</p>
  <p>What I noticed, however, was just how many lines my sketches seemed to have by the end of a session. Too many lines, sometimes, that it can be difficult to pick out details until I colour them in. But I was watching TobySketchLoose talk about keeping two different sizes of fineliners on hand, one thin and one thick, in his <a href="https://youtu.be/DdbQLBdhMcY?feature=shared">Urban Sketching for Beginners - Step by Step - Tutorial</a>. It made sense, varying the lines' sizes to make your drawings interesting, less uniform. I wanted at least several of my sketches to be able to stand alone, rather than get propped up by colors all the time.</p>

  <h2>Tutorials referenced</h2>
  <p>I don't want to pressure myself; journaling gave my mind clarity. But that doesn't mean I don't want to improve my sketching skills, because drawing and painting engaged me with my surroundings, made me pay attention to them, and as a result, made me remember what I'd been doing and where I'd been.</p>

  <p>These YouTubers' videos helped me make better - and more fun - sketches:</p>

  </ul>
  <p>I also relied on books, which I completed to varying degrees:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Sketch Now, Think Later, by Mike Daikubara</li>
    <li>Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain, by Betty Edwards</li>
    <li>How to Draw: Drawing and Sketching Objects and Environments From Your Imagination, by Scott Robertson, Thomas Bertling</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Techniques</h2>
  <h3>Urban sketching, specifically</h3>
  <p>Mike Daikubara's Sketch Now, Think Later was the first "art" book I read. Much of how I approach urban sketching, and how I define urban sketching, came from it, little nuggets of advice that are more practical than really technique:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>It's okay to stand while sketching. It keeps you alert of your surroundings, which is always important, especially in an urban setting. But it also encourages you to move around and find the angle of the subject you want to draw.</li>
    <li>Don't be afraid to draw over your original sketch with ink if you make a mistake. E.g. if you're drawing a car tyre and it's too big the first time, just draw over it the second or third time, confidently, and correct the shape. Very quickly, the mistake blends into the drawing itself and gives it character.</li>
    <li>When watercolouring or filling in details with ink, there's no need to colour or shade every inch or every detail. You could do it for a small area, e.g. outline a few bricks here and there in a building and colour them in. Making mere suggestions of the texture and colours is enough for a sketch.</li>
    <li>Always finish your sketches.</li>
