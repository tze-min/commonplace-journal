    <h2>Starting out</h2>

    <p>My relationship with poetry started when I went on a roadtrip across the southwest of the USA with my family. I was neither driver nor navigator, so I had time. Hours of dusty highways and rusty mesas, and similarly importantly, I had a travel notebook in my hands.</p>
    <p>I'd bought that on a whim from a cafe bookstore near my workplace, a faux leather-bound, ecomaz notebook with two inserts. Maybe it was something about the thinness of each insert that made me itch to write, because it didn't feel too intimidating of a commitment? Either way, I started scribbling, here and there, just words that came to mind that amused me during the hours of driving from town to town.</p>
    <p>Still, I couldn't write for five hours straight in a shaky car or I'd puke over the seats, so I ended up reading a couple of pre-downloaded books as well. And these books were:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>The Haiku Form, by Joan Giroux</li>
        <li>The Ode Less Travelled, by Stephen Fry</li>
    </ul>

    <p>They changed my life.</p>
