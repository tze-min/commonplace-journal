    <h1>Taking the 2024 CCAI Summer School</h1>

    <h2>About CCAI</h2>
    <p>Climate Change AI is a non-profit I've followed for a while (they have a newsletter). This year was the first time I signed up for their <a href="https://www.climatechange.ai/events/summer_school2024">annual summer school</a>, where they get professors and industry speakers to give introductory lectures about the use of AI/ML techniques in different domains of climate change.</p>
    <p>I paid 30 SGD for access to a series of virtual lectures and tutorials, most of which were honestly pretty solid! You don't have to complete everything, and access is indefinite after payment, though you do get a certificate if you submit at least eight assessments/feedback forms before the summer ends.</p>

    <h2>Lectures and thoughts</h2>
    <p>These are the lectures I watched. I've starred the ones I thought stood out in terms of the comprehensiveness of content, the quality of delivery, and where I felt I learned a lot.</p>

        <dt><a href="https://youtu.be/99U0ePt9DzY">Introduction to AI for Agriculture</a> (Prof Hannah Kerner, NASA Harvest & ASU Center for Global Discovery and Conservation Science @ Arizona State University) ★</dt>
        <dd>A crash course on the relationship between agriculture and climate change. Opportunities for AI/ML lie in the intersections between remote sensing, agriculture/food security and in-situ sensing. Prof Kerner covered a lot of ground about what stakeholders want and the common types of datasets used too.</dd>

        <dt><a href="https://youtu.be/99U0ePt9DzY?feature=shared&t=3788">Forests & Land Systems</a> (Dr David Dao, Gainforest.Earth & ETH BiodivX)</dt>
        <dd>That ML can process public remote imagery efficiently and turn third-party certifiers' manual reporting into machine-assisted reporting efforts were my key takeaways in this lecture, interspersed with forest soundscapes and Dr Dao's personal photographs.</dd>

        <dt><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9TIRncO9HE&feature=youtu.be">Machine learning for animal conservation: from sensors to knowledge</a> (Davis Tuia, ECEO Laboratory, EPFL) ★</dt>
        <dd>Prof Tuia structured this presentation super well, keeping the overview concise. He spent juicy amounts of time covering how sensors collect biodiversity data and four different ML approaches for conservation (detection and localisation of animals, individual identification, posture estimation and environmental reconstruction).</dd>

        <dt><a href="https://youtu.be/I9TIRncO9HE?feature=shared&t=3830">AI for Conservation Decisions</a> (Lily Xu, University of Oxford & Columbia University)</dt>

        <dt><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-rbAyZuZjo">Climate Innovation Policy</a> (Alice Lépissier, Green Finance AI) ★</dt>
        <dd>Her presentation blew me away.</dd>
