    <p>One of the annoying problems I've been facing at work is making my SQL queries in Snowflake run more quickly. It didn't use to be a problem I thought about, because the previous pressing issue had been to make a dataset available in the first place, to get a set of dashboards up and running in the first place, speed and performance be damned.</p>
    <p>Now that those <em>are</em> up and running, having slow queries and slower dashboards are a pain.</p>
    <p>But to make any speed improvement, I must first understand query profiles.</p>
    <p>Transactional table vs operational table</p>
