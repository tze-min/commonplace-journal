    <h2>About CCAI</h2>
    <p>Climate Change AI (CCAI) is a non-profit I've followed for a while (they have a newsletter). This year was the first time I signed up for their <a href="https://www.climatechange.ai/events/summer_school2024">annual summer school</a>, where they get professors and industry speakers to give introductory lectures about the use of AI/ML techniques in different domains of climate change.</p>
    <p>I paid 30 SGD for access to a series of virtual lectures and tutorials, most of which were honestly pretty solid! You don't have to complete everything, and access is indefinite after payment, though you do get a certificate if you submit at least eight assessments/feedback forms before the summer ends.</p>

    <h2>Lectures and thoughts</h2>
    <p>These are the lectures I watched. I've starred the ones I thought stood out in terms of the comprehensiveness of content, the quality of delivery, and where I felt I learned a lot.</p>
    <dl>
        <dt><a href="https://youtu.be/99U0ePt9DzY">Introduction to AI for Agriculture</a> (Prof Hannah Kerner, NASA Harvest & ASU Center for Global Discovery and Conservation Science @ Arizona State University) ★</dt>
        <dd>A crash course on the relationship between agriculture and climate change. Opportunities for AI/ML lie in the intersections between remote sensing, agriculture/food security and in-situ sensing. Prof Kerner covered a lot of ground about what stakeholders want and the common types of datasets used too.</dd>

        <dt><a href="https://youtu.be/99U0ePt9DzY?feature=shared&t=3788">Forests & Land Systems</a> (Dr David Dao, Gainforest.Earth & ETH BiodivX)</dt>
        <dd>My key takeaways from this lecture: 1) ML processes high volumes of public remote imagery efficiently, 2) ML turns manual reporting of situations on the ground into machine-assisted reporting. Dr Dao interspersed it with forest soundscapes and personal photographs from his work at Gainforest.Earth, a non-profit he cofounded. This was the first time I learned that applying AI/ML on bioacoustics was an active field of study.</dd>

        <dt><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9TIRncO9HE&feature=youtu.be">Machine learning for animal conservation: from sensors to knowledge</a> (Davis Tuia, ECEO Laboratory, EPFL) ★</dt>
        <dd>Prof Tuia structured this presentation super well, keeping the overview concise. He spent juicy amounts of time covering how sensors collect biodiversity data and four different ML approaches for conservation (detection and localisation of animals, individual identification, posture estimation and environmental reconstruction).</dd>

        <dt><a href="https://youtu.be/I9TIRncO9HE?feature=shared&t=3830">AI for Conservation Decisions</a> (Lily Xu, University of Oxford & Columbia University)</dt>
        <dd>AI/ML opportunities in conservation efforts were pretty theoretical in this presentation. Prof Xu focused on drawing parallels between classical ML applications with how they are currently used -- but mostly how they can be potentially used -- in conservation (e.g. predicting where poachers place animal traps to optimise rangers' patrol paths, given constraints such as rangers' limited number of hours).</dd>

        <dt><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-rbAyZuZjo">Climate Innovation Policy</a> (Alice Lépissier, Green Finance AI) ★</dt>
        <dd>Dr Lépissier's presentation blew me away. The segment on AI/ML opportunities in climate innovation policymaking was brief. But she made me understand, finally, how the state's financial engineering efforts derisk and foster the private sector's innovation in climate tech, because technological innovation can't exist in a vacuum. E.g. EV cars in California would not have taken off as much as it did without state-offered incentives to encourage its adoption. Reducing emissions is important, but progress will not sustain unless we replace the current economy with a low-carbon one, and it's financial incentives/carrots (e.g. subsidies, and not just disincentives/sticks like carbon taxes) that'll get us there. Like, wow? Suddenly the buzzwords clicked together; green finance used to be a black box to me.</dd>

        <dt><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5_R_5kJDas">AI for Climate Science</a> (Kai Jeggle, ETH Zürich & CCAI)</dt>
        <dd>Introduced basic atmospheric science theory and how climate data's characteristics (e.g. non-linear relationships between variables, high volume) make it suitable for ML research. AI models are also cheaper to run than traditional climate models. Raised two examples of ML applications and the main challenges this field faces.</dd>

        <dt><a href="https://youtu.be/P5_R_5kJDas?feature=shared&t=3788">An introduction to AI for weather forecasting</a> (Peetak Mitra, Excarta)</dt>
        <dd>A highly technical lecture on short/medium-term weather forecast models used in the industry, especially vision and SWIN transformers. Not all terms are defined, so will need to do some independent research!</dd>

        <dt><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3_jE0ZqsMM">Machine learning for emissions accounting and monitoring</a> (Kasia Tokarska de los Santos, CarbonPool)</dt>
        <dd>Taught GHG Protocol's definitions of Scope 1-3. High-level presentation of ML techniques reported by papers and organisations in emissions accounting (e.g. predicting missing corporate emissions from voluntarily reported ESG metrics) and monitoring (e.g. estimating regional emissions through remote sensing of biomass).</dd>

        <dt><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJsRRDy3WHQ">Empirical quantification of how the climate impacts socio-economic outcomes</a> (Jonathan Proctor, University of British Columbia) ★</dt>
        <dd>This was an amazing lecture. It's not exactly <em>AI</em>, but I began to understand how climate scientists isolate and quantify relationships between climate variables (e.g. temperature, soil moisture) and some outcome (e.g. human mortality, crop yield), while accounting for variations across time and space, as well as datasets with varying granularities.</dd>

        <dt><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJ__2-qViCM">Role of data and AI for climate change mitigation and adaptation in cities</a> (Angel Hsu, Data-Driven EnviroLab, University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill)</dt>
        <dd>A high-level overview of how applying NLP techniques and generative AI on policy papers is key to understanding how cities mitigate climate change effects, as well as how geospatial analytics enable cities to adapt to climate change.</dd>

        <dt><a href="https://youtu.be/RJ__2-qViCM?feature=shared&t=3720">(Geo)AI for Buildings and Cities</a> (Filip Biljecki, Urban Analytics Lab @ National University of Singapore)</dt>
        <dd>Finding high volumes of quality data about buildings is a <em>huge</em> challenge. Prof Biljecki spent significant time covering emerging datasets and how they're mined/generated: street view imagery, user-generated geographic information (e.g. OpenStreetMap, real estate ads), AI models that generate building data, programmes to collect occupant information from wearables. Covered a bit about developing metrics to characterise buildings, as well as data quality and model accuracy.</dd>

        <dt><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5VuaWaYsLU">GHG Impact Assessment of AI</a> (Lynn Kaack, Hertie School & CCAI and George Kamiya, led IEA's analysis on energy/climate impact of digitalisation)</dt>
        <dd>Kamiya led the lecture on  AI/ML's compute-related impacts, while Prof Kaack led the one on system-level impacts. The main takeaways were 1) we lack data to understand how ML uses energy, and 2) governmental organisations are developing regulation, monitoring programmes and research initiatives to understand ML's societal impacts. The value here lies in their references to other studies, programmes and publications.</dd>

        <dt><a href="https://youtu.be/G5VuaWaYsLU?feature=shared&t=3735">Responsible AI and Sustainability</a> (Dr Sasha Luccioni, Hugging Face, Women in Machine Learning & CCAI) ★</dt>
        <dd>Insightful presentation about the theory vs practice of implementing ethical, sustainable AI. She also introduced recurring themes in this topic's research: representativeness of AI models, their transparency, equity, and how they're evaluated for metrics beyond accuracy, such as models' fairness, data quality, robustness and efficiency.</dd>

        <dt><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8CYBqgAPAc&feature=youtu.be">ML for Power & Energy Systems</a> (Prof Priya L Donti, EECS & LIDS and Dr Nsutezo Simone Fobi, Microsoft AI for Good Research Lab) ★</dt>
        <dd>Solid overview of how ML's applied in the operations, planning, innovation and data management of power systems, and how it can improved our understanding of the energy market. Introduces the domain of electric grids, too, and emphasises the importance of being practical with the ML used.</dd>

        <dt><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i23jr7pkjsM&feature=youtu.be">AI for Transportation</a> (Nikola Milojevic-Dupont @ MCC Berlin & Felix Wagner @ Technical University Berlin)</dt>
        <dd>Speakers broke the lecture into two sections: covering an overview of the transport sector and its emissions, followed by specific examples of how AI/ML's used in it. The interactive exercises, e.g. developing metrics and gathering datasets on demand trip forecasting, seemed especially useful in getting the audience to think.</dd>

        <dt><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mtbFx_8VVc">Artificial Intelligence for Planetary Health: Challenges, Opportunities, and Human Choice</a> (Prof Sara Khalid, Planetary Health Informatics Lab & Centre for Statistics in Medicine @ University of Oxford)</dt>
        <dd>Brief overview of planetary health analytics, including the applications (e.g. early warning systems for flood, heat, disease outbreaks, etc.), how datasets from patients and about the climate can be geographically linked for analysis, and challenges faced in this field (e.g. biased data).</dd>
